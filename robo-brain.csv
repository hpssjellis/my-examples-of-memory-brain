Cattell's Investment Theory,"Fluid Intelligence (Gf) as 'raw intelligence' is invested in learning, which builds Crystallized Intelligence (Gc). The act of learning and applying these skills is the investment process itself.","Crystallized Intelligence (Gc) is the result, not the process. The passive acquisition of facts without applying them."
