Theory,"Robotics, Coding, & 3D Printing Actively Train",Minimal Effect on
Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) Theory,"Fluid Reasoning ($Gf$), Quantitative Reasoning ($Gq$), Short-Term Memory ($Gsm$), Long-Term Storage and Retrieval ($Glr$), Visual-Spatial Processing ($Gv$), Processing Speed ($Gs$)","Crystallized Knowledge ($Gc$), Reading and Writing Ability ($Grw$), Auditory Processing ($Ga$)"
Spearman's Two-Factor Theory,General Intelligence (g factor),Specific factors (s factors) not related to the task
Sternberg's Triarchic Theory,"Analytical Intelligence, Creative Intelligence, Practical Intelligence",Minimal as the skills span all three components
Guilford's Structure of Intellect,"Operations: Cognition, Memory, Production, Evaluation. Content: Symbolic. Products: Units, Classes, Relations, Systems","Content: Visual, Auditory, Behavioral. Products: Transformations, Implications"
Thurstone's Primary Mental Abilities,"Reasoning, Numerical Ability, Spatial Visualization, Perceptual Speed, Inductive & Deductive Reasoning, Problem-Solving","Verbal Comprehension, Word Fluency, Memory"
Vernon's Hierarchical Theory,"g Factor, Perceptual-Mechanical (k:m) Factor: Spatial, Practical, Mechanical Abilities","Verbal-Educational (v:ed) Factor: Verbal, Educational Abilities"
Carroll's Three-Stratum Theory,"Stratum III: g factor. Stratum II: Fluid Intelligence ($Gf$), Broad Visual Perception ($Gv$), Broad Cognitive Speediness ($Gs$), Broad Retrieval Ability ($Gr$)","Stratum II: Crystallized Intelligence ($Gc$), Broad Auditory Perception ($Gu$), Quantitative Knowledge ($Gq$)"
Cattell's Investment Theory,Fluid Intelligence ($Gf$) as a process of investing in learning to build skills,"Crystallized Intelligence ($Gc$) as a static result, not the process"
Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development,"Adaptation, Assimilation, Accommodation, Problem-solving",The theory is developmental; it doesn't isolate skills that aren't trained
