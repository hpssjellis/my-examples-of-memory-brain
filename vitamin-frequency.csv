Supplement,Max Dose (Single),Max Duration (Frequency),Logic/Constraint,Training/Injury Note
HMB,3g,12 hours,Leucine metabolite; rapid clearance. Needs 2x daily for anti-catabolic effect.,Increase to 3x daily during hamstring repair.
Creatine,5g,24 hours,Requires muscle saturation. 24h is the limit before stores begin slow decline.,Keep daily until bruise/tear is fully remodeled.
B100 Complex,1 Tablet,5 days,High-dose water soluble. 5 days avoids 'expensive urine' while maintaining levels.,Shorten to 3 days if CNS fatigue is high.
Vitamin C,1000mg,12 hours,Bowell tolerance/renal threshold. Excess is excreted rapidly.,Take 500mg 2x daily for collagen synthesis.
Vitamin D3,5000IU,7 days,Fat soluble; stored in adipose tissue. Weekly dosing is clinically effective.,Maintain weekly; critical for muscle force production.
Magnesium Glycinate,400mg,24 hours,Regulates 300+ enzymes. Rapidly used during muscle repair/sleep.,Take before bed to assist with injury-related muscle guarding.
Collagen Peptides,20g,24 hours,Provides hydroxyproline for tendon/ligament repair. High turnover in injury.,Mandatory daily for that 2x5 inch bruise repair.
Whey Protein,30g,4-6 hours,Leucine threshold for protein synthesis is transient.,Prioritize 30g within 2 hours post-sprint.
Zinc (Gluconate),30mg,24 hours,Essential for cell division and tissue growth (hamstring repair).,Do not exceed 40mg/day long-term (copper depletion).
Omega-3 (EPA/DHA),2000mg,48 hours,Incorporates into cell membranes. 48h maintains anti-inflammatory flux.,High dose helps with the '2x5 inch' hematoma resolution.
