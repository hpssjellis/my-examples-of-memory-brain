Nutrient,Solubility Type,"Key Half-Life for Re-dosing","Expected Range for Intermittent Dosing (Days)",Key Comment
"Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)",Water-Soluble,"~ 8 to 40 days",Daily,"Though the half-life is longer than other water-soluble vitamins, it's constantly being used (especially under stress/for salt absorption) and is often recommended daily."
"Folate (B9)",Water-Soluble,"~ 4 months (Liver Stores)","2 to 4","The total body store is large, but the *functional* plasma half-life is quite short (hours), similar to the other B's. A **daily to every few days** approach is generally needed for consistent supply."
Magnesium,"Electrolyte/Mineral","~ 42 days (Long-term Store)","1 to 2","While the total-body store (in bone) lasts weeks, the *blood* magnesium is tightly regulated, and the excess from a dose is rapidly excreted within **12 to 48 hours**."
"Potassium & Calcium","Electrolyte/Mineral","~ 4 hours",Daily,"The body's need for these is critical and continuous. They are tightly regulated and rapidly excreted, meaning daily intake is essential."
"Vitamin D (D3)",Fat-Soluble,"~ 15 days","7 to 14","This is the circulating active form's half-life. Its long half-life makes **weekly or bi-weekly** dosing a very sensible approach."
"Vitamin K (MK-7)",Fat-Soluble,"~ 3 days","3 to 5","Vitamin K1 (short) and MK-7 (long) have different half-lives. MK-7's longer half-life makes **every few days** a good fit for cyclical dosing."
"Vitamin A",Fat-Soluble,"~ 128 days","30 to 90","Highly fat-soluble, most of the dose is stored in the liver. It should only be taken with very long, widely spaced intervals to avoid potential toxicity. **Monthly** is a conservative choice."
"Vitamin E (Alpha-Tocopherol)",Fat-Soluble,"~ Several days to weeks","5 to 10","Stored in fatty tissue. A large dose will maintain levels for an extended period, making a **weekly** interval a good choice."
