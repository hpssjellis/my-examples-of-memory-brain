Nutrient Solubility Type Key Half-Life for Re-dosing Expected Range for Intermittent Dosing (Days) Key Comment
Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) Water-Soluble \approx 8 \text{ to } 40 \text{ days} Daily Though the half-life is longer than other water-soluble vitamins, it's constantly being used (especially under stress/for salt absorption) and is often recommended daily.
Folate (B9) Water-Soluble \approx 4 \text{ months (Liver Stores)} 2 to 4 The total body store is large, but the functional plasma half-life is quite short (hours), similar to the other B's. A daily to every few days approach is generally needed for consistent supply.
Magnesium Electrolyte/Mineral \approx 42 \text{ days (Long-term Store)} 1 to 2 While the total-body store (in bone) lasts weeks, the blood magnesium is tightly regulated, and the excess from a dose is rapidly excreted within 12 to 48 hours.
Potassium & Calcium Electrolytes/Minerals \approx 4 \text{ hours} Daily The body's need for these is critical and continuous. They are tightly regulated and rapidly excreted, meaning daily intake is essential.
Vitamin D (D3) Fat-Soluble \approx 15 \text{ days} 7 to 14 This is the circulating active form's half-life. Its long half-life makes weekly or bi-weekly dosing a very sensible approach.
Vitamin K (MK-7) Fat-Soluble \approx 3 \text{ days} 3 to 5 Vitamin K1 (short) and MK-7 (long) have different half-lives. MK-7's longer half-life makes every few days a good fit for cyclical dosing.
Vitamin A Fat-Soluble \approx 128 \text{ days} 30 to 90 Highly fat-soluble, most of the dose is stored in the liver. It should only be taken with very long, widely spaced intervals to avoid potential toxicity. Monthly is a conservative choice.
Vitamin E (Alpha-Tocopherol) Fat-Soluble \approx \text{Several days to weeks} 5 to 10 Stored in fatty tissue. A large dose will maintain levels for an extended period, making a weekly interval a good choice.
