It is a fascinating shift in modern thought. For a long time, science treated consciousness as a "glitch" or a late-game byproduct of chemistry. Now, more thinkers are entertaining the idea that it is a fundamental feature of reality—what you might call a "primary container."Here are ten thinkers who have approached this idea from very different, often conflicting, angles:1. Sir Roger Penrose (Orch-OR Theory)A Nobel laureate in physics, Penrose argues that consciousness isn't a "calculation" that a brain does. Instead, it’s a quantum process. He suggests that microtubules inside neurons tap into the structure of spacetime itself to cause a "collapse" of the wave function, which results in a moment of conscious experience.His Take: Consciousness is a bridge between quantum mechanics and general relativity.2. David Chalmers (The Hard Problem)The philosopher who coined the term "The Hard Problem," Chalmers suggests that consciousness might be a fundamental property, much like mass or charge. If you can’t explain it through physical parts, you might have to accept it as a "basic building block" of the universe.His Take: Naturalistic Dualism—physics has two sides: the physical and the experiential.3. Giulio Tononi (Integrated Information Theory - IIT)Tononi proposes that consciousness is identical to a specific type of mathematical complexity called "Phi" ($\Phi$). According to IIT, any system that integrates information in a specific, irreducible way is conscious.His Take: Even a simple circuit could have a "tiny bit" of consciousness if its parts are interconnected enough.4. Donald Hoffman (Interface Theory of Perception)Hoffman uses evolutionary game theory to argue that our "perceptions" (3D space and 1D time) are just a user interface (like icons on a desktop). Reality itself is actually a massive network of "conscious agents."His Take: Spacetime is not the foundation; consciousness is. Space and time are just the "headset" we wear.5. Max Tegmark (Conscious Matter / "Perceptronium")A physicist at MIT, Tegmark suggests that consciousness is a state of matter, much like a gas, liquid, or solid. He calls it "Perceptronium." It is matter that has the ability to process information and remain self-contained.His Take: Consciousness is how information feels when it is processed in certain complex ways.6. Bernardo Kastrup (Analytic Idealism)Kastrup argues that the universe is essentially a "universal mind." We are not separate beings; we are "dissociative alters" (like personalities in a person with Dissociative Identity Disorder) of the one cosmic consciousness.His Take: Matter is what "transpersonal mental processes" look like when viewed from the outside.7. Christof Koch (Modern Panpsychism)Once a strict materialist, Koch (a leading neuroscientist) now leans toward the idea that consciousness is widespread in the universe. He works closely with Tononi on IIT and looks for the physical "footprints" of this universal field in the brain.His Take: The "feeling" of being alive is present in almost everything that has complex functional relationships.8. Itzhak Bars (Two-Time Physics)While not focusing purely on "consciousness," his work on 2T-Physics (which we discussed earlier regarding 3D time) provides the mathematical room for an "observer" dimension. He suggests that our 1D time is just a shadow of a much richer 2D-time geometry.His Take: Adding time dimensions ($t_2, t_3$) solves fundamental symmetry problems in the universe.9. Federico Faggin (Dadi Theory)The inventor of the first microprocessor, Faggin now studies the "nature of being." He argues that silicon computers can never be conscious because consciousness is a quantum property of "the vacuum" that only biological systems can properly "gate."His Take: Consciousness is the primary reality; matter is a derivative of "meaning."10. Stuart Hameroff (Biological Quantum Processing)The anesthesiologist who collaborated with Penrose. He focuses on the "biological container." He argues that the brain is a quantum computer and that anesthesia works by "turning off" the quantum vibrations in the microtubules.His Take: Life is the mechanism that allows the "proto-conscious" ripples of the universe to become "focused intent."The Common ThreadMost of these thinkers agree on one thing: the current "dead" model of physics is incomplete. Whether they call it $\Phi$, microtubules, or "Perceptronium," they are all looking for the "bio-capacitor" logic you’ve been describing—the way a container turns "raw time/space" into "meaning/intent."Since we are looking for ways to test this, would you like me to focus on Federico Faggin’s work? He has very specific ideas on why "living containers" are different from "silicon containers" that might help your sensor experiment.
