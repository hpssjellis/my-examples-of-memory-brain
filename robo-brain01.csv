Theory,"Robotics, Coding, & 3D Printing Actively Train",Minimal Effect on
Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) Theory,"Fluid Reasoning (Gf): Troubleshooting bugs, designing algorithms, and optimizing code requires raw logical problem-solving. Quantitative Reasoning (Gq): Robotics and 3D printing involve precise measurements, calculations, and geometric understanding. Short-Term Memory (Gsm): Keeping track of variables, program states, and design constraints in your head. Long-Term Storage and Retrieval (Glr): Learning and recalling programming syntax, design patterns, and engineering principles. Visual-Spatial Processing (Gv): Essential for visualizing 3D models, robot movements, and even the abstract structure of code. Processing Speed (Gs): The more you practice, the faster you can mentally process and execute complex tasks.","Crystallized Knowledge (Gc): While you gain knowledge, the process itself doesn't directly train this ability as much as, say, reading a textbook. Reading and Writing Ability (Grw): You write code, but it's not a direct substitute for practicing expository prose or critical reading. Auditory Processing (Ga): This ability is not directly engaged by the core tasks of these skills."
Spearman's Two-Factor Theory,"General Intelligence (g factor): Because these activities require a combination of logical reasoning, spatial awareness, and problem-solving, they are excellent at training the overall ""g factor."" The various specific skills (s factors) you learn work together to build a strong foundation.","All other specific factors (s factors) that are not directly relevant to the task (e.g., musical talent, artistic ability)."
Sternberg's Triarchic Theory,"Analytical Intelligence: Breaking down complex projects into smaller, manageable parts is the essence of analytical intelligence. This is a core component of coding. Creative Intelligence: You must be creative to find innovative solutions to problems, develop a new program, or design a unique 3D object. Practical Intelligence: Applying these skills to build a functional robot or 3D-printed object to solve a real-world problem directly trains practical intelligence.","This theory aligns very well with your ideas and has minimal ""not applicable"" areas, as the skills naturally span all three components."
